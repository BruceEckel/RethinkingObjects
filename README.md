# Rethinking Objects

Code Examples From the Book.

This repository uses the Pants 2 build system, which runs under Linux. If you
are running on either MacOS or Linux, you're ready to use this repository if you
know how to use the Linux terminal on those systems (although you might still
need to install additional Python interpreters, described later in this README).

On Windows, Pants only runs under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). (_They are working on supporting Windows directly)._ If you have not installed WSL on your
machine, [these instructions will guide you](https://github.com/BruceEckel/ConfiguringForPants).
